**push_swap : Solving a "Tower of Hanoi like" puzzle using sequential access sorting algorithms.**

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting.

**the catch**
Starting with randomly ordered integers on one stack, we must order these by means of a second empty stack and a limited movements set :

* Pushing the topmost value of a stack to the next stack ( pa, pb )

* Swapping both topmost values of stack a, stack b or both ( sa, sb, ss )

* Rotating the topmost value of stack a, stack b or both under their bottom ( ra, rb, rr )

* Rotating the bottommost value of stack a, stack b or both over their top ( rra, rrb, rrr )

Algo 100% 5/5 for a 100 - 4/5 for a 500

______________

Wiki:

For a 100, find the 20 smallest values in *stack.a*, and *push* into *stack.b*.
Then find the next 20 smallest values that remain in *stack.a*, until *stack.a* is empty.
Then, find the biggest value in *stack.b* by *rotate* or *reverse-rotate*, and *push* it back into *stack.a*.
For a 500, change the chunk size to 70, more or less.

Optimisation :

While searching for a value between 0 and 20 to push, split it into *push* a chunk of 0 to 10, and *push* + *reverse rotate* 10 to 20.
